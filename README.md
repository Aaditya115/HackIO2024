# HackIO24

1. designing an App

    1. primary function
      within that app the front facing camera tracks eye and head movement based on those paramaters we can conclude if that person is distracted or not distracted. If they are distracted send a message or alert (phone buzz or something similar).

    2. secondary function
      front facing camera constantly uses device speed and distance from the camera to detect if you are going to rear end someone and send an alert.

    3. Tri Function:
      Map, because we need to have an excuse for the user to use our app in the first place. Unless they have carplay.
